# NanoPC-T4-Kernel
Custom ElementalX kernel for my Nanopc-T4 by friendlyarm


The development process I followed for building this kernel can be found here: https://github.com/flar2/angler/tree/ElementalX-6.00/Documentation/development-process

I took the ElementalX kernel I use for my Nexus 6p and adapted it to the NanoPC-T4 I bought to run my custom head unit for my car.

Elemental kernel's website can be found here: https://elementalx.org/

The source code for the NanoPC-T4 kernel I used can be found here: https://gitlab.com/friendlyelec/rk3399-android-8.1/tree/master/kernel

This project is still very much a work in progress,
